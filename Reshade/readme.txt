If you install the Reshade I posted or don't believe it, 
download the latest version from the official site. 
If you proceed to Direct 11, Reshade will work normally in ASA.
And the reflection hasn't been patched since, so I just updated it myself. 
I'm a developer, not a dictator. 
I think it's the literacy of programmers to want to try anything good and interesting. 
Whether it's good or bad, I'm the only one who has it. 
I continued to use edit d3d9.dll with hexeditor even after the reshade was blocked in Ark 1 when others ppl cant use becasue of block reshade by BE.
There's never been a ban i got yet.
#If it doesn't work on the official server, change it through the console command.
BUT
Use own risk

VAMOS!


It was in ark 1 reshade with reflection.
